Revision history for Trait::Traced

v0.0.1:
    - Implement support for tracing routine calls
    - Implement support for tracing methods of types
    - Implement support for tracing multi methods of types

v0.1.0:
    - Make tracing thread-safe.
    - Implement the API for custom tracers that was a skeleton prior.  This
      abstracts most of the logic for stringifying traces out of any classes
      that handle tracing, and formally introduces the common output format that
      all types of traces will be expected to use.
    - Fix some bugs in routine tracing. This includes tracing of both the proto
      and multi of a multiple dispatch routine throwing, and redundantly traced
      methods of a traced type tracing calls to the internal TRACED-ROUTINE
      routine.

v0.1.1:
    - Fix compiler error on Rakudo v2019.11.

v0.1.2:
    - Make routine call tracing more accurate when threads are involved by
      optimizing Traced::Routine.entries.

v0.2.0:
    - Implement support for tracing private methods.
    - Implement support for tracing metamethods.
    - Implement support for tracing stash lookups, binds, and assignments.
    - Properly make traced call frame tracking thread-safe.
    - Fix bug where traced routines would claim their name is TRACED-ROUTINE
      instead of the original routine's name.

v0.2.1:
    - Optimize trace timestamp generation. This makes it so traces take a
      negligable amount of time to generate.
